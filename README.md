# Sensor Data Logger

A JavaScript-based project designed to read and log specific information from various sensors: Such as temperature, humidity, motion, etc into graphs and tables for analysis and automation of artefact preservation

## 🌍 Overview

This project provides a modular framework for connecting, reading, and storing sensor data.  
It can be used for:
- Environmental monitoring (e.g. temperature, humidity, light levels)
- Motion detection
- Aiding in transporting fragile artefacts, medicine and art
